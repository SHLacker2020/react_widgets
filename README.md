This is a simple collection of widgets built with simple React components.
This repo is displayed for the code, not a finished project. It is more of a
boilerplate code for anyone who would like to start messing with React
components and API's.

## How to see the webpage ##
* Clone the repository.
* cd into apps root dir.
* Run `npm install`
* Add an API key to the weather component located in ~/frontend/components/weather.jsx
  * This is optional if you would like the weather widget to work properly, I avoided
  using my own API key for protection against web scraping.
* Run `npm run start`
* Open up ./index.html with a live server to check out the widgets, add your own react components, change up the styling and have fun with it!
